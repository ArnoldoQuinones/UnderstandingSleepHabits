    <h2>Facts and Opinions</h2>
    <p>Opinion: Many believe college students frequently sacrifice sleep to stay on top of classes, social life, and part-time work, often treating sleep as a luxury rather than a necessity.</p>
    <p>Fact: Studies show that over 60% of college students experience poor sleep quality, with many averaging fewer than 7 hours of sleep per night.</p>
    <p>	</p>
    <p>Opinion: Some feel that society has normalized a "sleep later" mindset, encouraging the idea that rest can be postponed or caught up on during weekends or breaks.</p>
    <p>Fact: Sleep research shows that sleep debt accumulates and cannot be fully repaid by sleeping in occasionally, leading to continued fatigue and disrupted circadian rhythms.</p>
    <p>	</p>
    <p>Opinion: People increasingly appreciate how technology like sleep trackers and wellness apps help raise awareness about healthy sleep habits and encourage better routines.</p>
    <p>Fact: However, studies have identified a condition called orthosomnia, where individuals become overly focused on sleep tracking, causing anxiety that can actually worsen sleep quality.</p>
    <p>	</p>
    <p>Opinion: Many argue that college culture glorifies all-nighters and views constant tiredness as a sign of hard work and dedication.</p>
    <p>Fact: Research shows that chronic sleep deprivation among students is linked to lower academic performance, impaired memory, and higher levels of stress and depression.</p>
